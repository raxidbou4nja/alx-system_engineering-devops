**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: February 18, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
  - End Time: February 18, 2024, 3:30 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - The outage affected the user authentication service, rendering it inaccessible for approximately 30% of our users.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.

**Timeline:**
- **Issue Detection:**
  - Detected: February 18, 2024, 10:15 AM (UTC)
  - Detection Method: Monitoring alert triggered due to a sudden spike in failed authentication requests.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated the authentication service logs for potential issues.
  - Assumed the issue might be related to the database, leading to a thorough examination of database connections.
  - Engaged the network team to check for any anomalies in the load balancer settings.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initially, the focus on database issues led to unnecessary resource allocation in that area.
  - A brief consideration of a DDoS attack was taken into account, leading to additional time spent investigating network traffic.
- **Escalation:**
  - The incident was escalated to the network and infrastructure team as load balancer misconfiguration became apparent.
- **Resolution:**
  - The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings was corrected, and the authentication service was restored to normal functioning.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause Explanation:**
  - The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an imbalance in traffic distribution, leading to the authentication service being overwhelmed and resulting in failed requests.
- **Resolution Details:**
  - Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers.
  - Monitoring alerts were fine-tuned to promptly detect and notify about load balancer misconfigurations in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Regular audits of load balancer configurations to ensure alignment with service requirements.
  - Enhanced monitoring for load balancer metrics to quickly identify and address any anomalies.
  - Documentation update to include load balancer configuration best practices.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Implement automated periodic checks for load balancer settings.
  2. Conduct a thorough review of monitoring alerts to avoid false positives and negatives.
  3. Update incident response procedures to include load balancer-related scenarios.
  4. Schedule a training session for the team to enhance awareness of load balancer configurations.
  5. Document lessons learned from this incident and share them with relevant teams.
